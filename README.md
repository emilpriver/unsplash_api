I made this website to show companys some code.

App fetches images from Unsplashs api and then show it for the user.

The api key are a public test key.

How to use: 
Register your app at unsplash and copy the public key.
Paste your public key in a .env file in the root folder. 
Start or restart the react-scripts and it should work! :) 


Happy hacking ðŸ˜Š
